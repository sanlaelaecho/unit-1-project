## Game Instruction
Naruto or Sasuke, who gets to go first is random and then it's a turned based game after that.
- Player can choose out of 4 spells to attack with the furthest right being the strongest spell.
- Whichever player's health goes down to 0 or lower dies and looses and the other player wins.
Now feel free to replay!

## Summarized Code Logic
- Carousel flips through array of different images.


## Next Steps
Add credit for the audio and the Naruto/Sasuke images.

I plan to improve my CSS to better orient the avatars and their animations. Also, add shadows or clouds under the avatars so they look less like they're floating. Improve the animations.

I also plan to try to get my audio linked to a YouTube video's audio and not downloaded or uploaded on GitHub. Also, add audio every time either Naruto or Sasuke uses their attacks. For eg, if Naruto uses Rasengan, he screams Rasengan in audio.

THANK YOU for playing my game!!!
